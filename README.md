# HTML-AND-CSS-PROJECTS

#This repository exists as part of the Tech Academy's course on HTML and CSS.  As a course covering the fundamentals of website creation, JavaScript may not be outside the scope of its contents.

Regardless, the respository now contains:
  The One Page Website, which demonstrates basic hmtl and css skills while talking (very briefly) about ecosystems.
  The Simple Recipes Website, which contains more advanced use of CSS and was a follow-along project.
  The Academy Cinemas Website, which was a continuation of the skills learned with the Simple Recipes page.
  The Challenge Page website, which was a self-led demonstration of skill with CSS where additional requirements were added sequentially to your original plan for the website.
  The Grace Hopper website, where we followed along with the instructor as he worked on a webpage.  The objective was to see what building a website actually looked like and to dispel any misconceptions we might have about the process.
  The Portfolio Page, which is a copy of the data that supports Arreclain.github.io
  The Pet Shop Website, which was made very early on, and is a travesty of css and html, but we all have to start somewhere.  : )
