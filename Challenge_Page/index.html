            <h3>What Kind of Art Unlocks Joy?</h3>
            <p>The kind of art you were taught was good was "good art." Or maybe even "skillful art." <br>
                I'm going to disagree with that. Good art is art that brings joy, or does not harm others.<br>
                It can be non-sensical. It can be silly. It can be poorly done. It can be all of these things and still
                bring joy. <br>
                Art can be self expression. It can be simply an act of play not yet shamed out of our lives and duties
                as adults.</p>
            <img src="images/abstract-art-1.jpg" class="center-block">
            <p>The question one asks when seeing the above should never be: "But did this make me money." <br>
                It should be, "Did I enjoy the process and did it make life a little more worth living?"</p>

                Since this website is principally a coding demonstration, I'm going to now show you how the fun isn't
                over once the art project is. <br>
                I will do the with the table below! Join me!
