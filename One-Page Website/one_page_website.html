	<!--ABOUT-->
	<p>
		This website is about giving a crude summary of some basic aspects of what an ecosystem is.  In the sections below, we will define what an ecosystem is, define many of its parts, and provide pictures to help key in readers.  This is supposed to be a one page website, and as this is not wikipedia, what can be accomplished here is very limited.

				<div id="ecosystem">
					<h3>
					An Ecosystem is a flow of energy and nutrients through the life forms in the area, as well as the land itself.

				<div id="autotroph"><!--AUTOTROPH OVERVIEW-->
					<h3>
					An autotroph is any organism that feeds itself.  For us land dwellers, those are plants, but don't be fooled, it isn't an exclusive club.  Not by a long shot.

				<div id="herbivore"><!--HERBIVORE OVERVIEW-->
					<h3>
					Herbivores are those that eat plants.

				<div id="carnivore"><!--CARNIVORE OVERVIEW-->
					<h3>
					Carnivores are those that eat other animals.  An ecosystem has layers, and there are often carnivores that eat other carnivores.  Just look at octopi and crabs.

				<div id="detritovore"><!--DETRITOVORE OVERVIEW-->
					<h3>
					These are animals that feed on decaying matter, dead matter, and waste.  They are nature's cleanup crew and are extremely vital to any ecosystem.

				<div id="disease"><!--DISEASE OVERVIEW-->
					<h3>
					Diseases and parasites are not often given the credit they are due.  Diseases impact and control the spread of every lifeform on earth, and parasites do a similar effect, if lesser in scope.  No apex predator is immune to disease.  Even disease causing bacteria can be attacked by viruses or other bacteria.

				<div id="keystone"><!--KEYSTONE SPECIES OVERVIEW-->
					<h3>
					A keystone species is a species with a disproportionally large impact on its environment, and specifically creates additional niches for life to occupy and stabilizes that ecosystem.  Designating a species as such is really more of a human convention, but there are some great canidates that make the term useful to know.

			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem">The term "ecosystem" was first used in 1935 in a publication by British ecologist Arthur Tansley. The term was coined by Arthur Roy Clapham, who came up with the word at Tansley's request.[6] Tansley devised the concept to draw attention to the importance of transfers of materials between organisms and their environment.[4]: 9  He later refined the term, describing it as "The whole system, ... including not only the organism-complex, but also the whole complex of physical factors forming what we call the environment".[3] Tansley regarded ecosystems not simply as natural units, but as "mental isolates".[3] Tansley later defined the spatial extent of ecosystems using the term "ecotope".[7]</blockquote>
